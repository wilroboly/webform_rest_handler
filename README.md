Webform REST Handler
====================

This module provides webforms with a way to store information in a RESTful way in some external system.

NOTE: This module is not to be confused with the functionality of https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_rest which provides Webform management VIA RESTful connections.

Introduction

There may come a time when you find you wish to store submission results in a system OTHER than drupal. You may find that you would like to do so without having to write another module or configure a service to be triggered POST the submission process in webform. Rather, you might like to have this process done WHILST the submission process is being done IN Drupal through the webform handler system. In those moments, this module will be for you.

By enabling this module, you will provide a type of action handler you can configure to act upon particular REST endpoints.
